This is a small utility developed for the Nintendo Wii which will synchronize the system time to the NTP time.
As timezones are not supported this will have to be adjusted manually by the user.

Timekeeping is done by reading the (ever incrementing) Real Time Clock (RTC) and a counter bias stored in a system configuration.
If you adjust your time in the wii menu or by using this program the counter bias is changed.
There is always a risk that updating this counter bias could corrupt your system as it is part of the system configuration.

I shall not be held responsible if this would happen.
I have of course tested this on my Wii system and it works for me.

Happy hacking!
